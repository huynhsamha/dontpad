# dontpad

## DEPRECATED

**Recently Heroku has stopped providing free deployment, and I don't have time to maintain this project anymore.**

**If you need to retrieve the information that you have saved on https://dontpad.herokuapp.com, you can contact me via email huynhha12798@gmail.com with subject "[dontpad] ...", I will resend that content from the database.**

**Sorry for the inconvenience.**
